##System Install
Highly opionated Bash Script to set up a new OS X machine with Homebrew, Cask, RMV, Rails etc.

As with all bash scripts **read it** before you run it. And if you don't understand it. **DON'T RUN IT**.

If you want to run it then :

    $ curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dwkns/system-install/master/install.sh | bash

##System Install
Bash Script to set up a new mac with Homebrew, Cask, RMV, Rails etc.

To use it :

   $ curl http://dwkns.com/install | bash

This runs the `install` file which downloads this repoistory and then calls the main install script `main-install-script.sh`.

As with all bash scripts ***read it*** before you run it. And if you don't understand it. DON'T RUN IT.
